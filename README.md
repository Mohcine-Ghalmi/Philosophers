## What is Philosophers?

The simulation consists of a group of philosophers sitting at a round table with a large bowl of spaghetti in the middle of the table. The philosophers alternate between eating, thinking, and sleeping.

While a philosopher is eating, they are not thinking nor sleeping; while thinking, they are not eating nor sleeping; and, while sleeping, they are not eating nor thinking.

There are also forks on the table. There are as many forks as philosophers, and a philosopher takes their right and left forks to eat, one in each hand. Once they have finished eating, they put their forks back on the table and start sleeping. Once awake, they start thinking again.

The simulation stops when a philosopher dies of starvation. Every philosopher needs to eat and should never starve. Philosophers don't speak with each other, and they don't know if another philosopher is about to die. Therefore, they should avoid dying.
